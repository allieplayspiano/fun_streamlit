    Completed: Workday <> Financial Force PTO Integration
    - Automating the creation of PTO assignments within Financial Force in order free up to 25% of time per week for Resource Delivery Managers. (Current process takes 5-10 hours per RDM). 
   
    Phase I of II Complete: Rebillable Expenses Automation \n
    Go-Live: July 13, 2023
    - Automatically syncing expenses submitted/approved in Workday for PS Engagements into Financial Force for billing, saving up to 8 hours a month for the PS Operations Team 

    In Flight: Billable Events
    - Eliminating the manual back-and-forth reconciliation process at month end to ultimately create Billable Events that will be picked up in the SnowBridge integration.

    In Flight: Status Reporting \n
    Potential Snow-on-Snow Use Case
    - Integrating disparate data sources (FinancialForce, Snowhouse, Tableau, etc) in order to automatically generate status reports for PS Engagements, which will ultimately save up to 3 hours/week per RSA in order to free up more time for engagements.

    In Flight: PS and EDU Case Management
    - While there is a standardized process for EDU case management, it lacks maturity. PS doesnâ€™t have a current process for logging cases for customers. This project will standardize and streamline the PS and EDU Case Management process to increase time to resolution and increase Customer Satisfaction.
